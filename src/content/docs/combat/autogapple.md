# AUTOGAPPLE

Automatically eats a golden apple when certain conditions are met.

**MinHealth:**
Minimum health threshold. If your health drops below this value, AutoGapple activates and eats a golden apple.

**MaxHealth:**
Maximum health at which AutoGapple will trigger. If your health is above this value, it will not eat a gapple. Useful to prevent wasting gapples when already nearly full. If MinHealth and MaxHealth are diffrent a random value between them will be chosen.

**ConsiderTargetHealth:**
When enabled, considers the health of your enemy. If the target has high health and you're low, it increases priority to eat a gapple.

**NotWhileKillAura:**
Prevents AutoGapple from activating while KillAura is running. Helps avoid fighting and eating.

**While Regeneration:**
Only eats a gapple if you're not already regenerating. Prevents overlapping or wasted regen effects.

**JumpAndPress:**
Makes your player jump and right-click when eating the gapple. Useful to bypass some anti-cheat checks or simulate legit behavior and makes you a little faster.
