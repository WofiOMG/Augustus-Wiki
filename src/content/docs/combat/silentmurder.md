title: SilentMurder
---
A stealth PvP module that silently switches to a weapon, attacks a target, and switches back instantly, without the weapon visibly appearing in your hand.

### TickDelay:
Number of ticks to wait between each attack.
Controls how frequently SilentMurder activates.
1 tick = 1/20th of a second

### Timer:
Adjusts the attack speed multiplier.
Works like a local speed hack just for this module.

### Bypass Balance Checks:
When enabled, SilentMurder will attempt to evade server-side balance or fairness checks that detect:
##### Fast item switching
##### Illegal attack rates
##### Inventory desync

 Helps the module stay undetected, especially on strict servers.
