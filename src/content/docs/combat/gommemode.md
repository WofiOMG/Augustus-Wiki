# GOMMEMODE
Silently switches to the strongest weapon in your inventory when dealing damage.

This way, opponents take damage from your strongest weapon (like a sword) while you keep the effects of the original item you‚Äôre holding (such as knockback from a stick).

It automates weapon switching to maximize damage and utility without manual input.
