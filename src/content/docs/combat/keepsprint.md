title: KeepSprint
---
Prevents the game from stopping your sprint when you attack or perform certain actions.
Vanilla behavior: When you hit an entity, Minecraft cancels your sprint. This module keeps you sprinting even after attacking.

### MoveSlowdownOnGround  
Prevents the slowdown effect when moving on the ground and using items (e.g., blocking with sword, eating). Helps maintain sprint.

### SprintOnGround  
Keeps sprinting enabled while on the ground â€” even when attacking. Overrides the vanilla sprint reset on hit.

### MoveSlowdownInAir  
Prevents movement slowdown when hitting enemies in the air.

### SprintOnGroundInAir  
When enabled, forces sprinting both on ground and in the air.

### Smart  
Uses smarter conditions to avoid triggering anti-cheat detections â€” for example, disabling KeepSprint when suspicious item use or invalid movement is detected.
