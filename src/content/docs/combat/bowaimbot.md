title: BowAimBot
---
BowAimbot automatically aims your bow at targets to improve accuracy and hit rate. It smoothly adjusts your aim and can auto-shoot when locked on, helping you land shots on enemies or other entities without manual aiming.

## Mode: New, Old

---
### Old:
Uses a simpler, more direct aiming method.

### New:
Uses a smoother, more advanced aiming method for more natural and harder-to-detect aiming.

### Rotation Modes:
Controls how your aim rotates to track targets.

#### Independent:
 Yaw and pitch rotate independently.

#### Linear:
 Smooth linear rotation towards target.

#### Curve
 Adds wave-like, sine curve motion to the rotation for more human-like movement.

### MinYawSpeed / MaxYawSpeed:
Minimum and maximum speed for horizontal rotation (left-right aiming).

### MinPitchSpeed / MaxPitchSpeed:
Minimum and maximum speed for vertical rotation (up-down aiming).

### MinYawAcceleration / MaxYawAcceleration:
Minimum and maximum acceleration for horizontal rotation speed, controlling how fast the speed changes.

### MinPitchAcceleration / MaxPitchAcceleration:
Minimum and maximum acceleration for vertical rotation speed.

### CurveRotationMode:

---
#### Interval:
Time between rotation updates in ticks (how often the aim adjusts).

#### Amplitude:
Controls the maximum strength of the wave motion in Curve mode (how much your aim wiggles).

### Frequency:
Controls how fast the wave oscillates in Curve mode (speed of the wiggle).

### MinRandomStrength / MaxRandomStrength:
Minimum and maximum randomness added to aim for more natural movement.

#### RandomizeOnlyAtRotation:
Whether to apply randomness only when the aim is rotating.

### BetterAcceleration:
Enhances acceleration handling for smoother and more natural aiming.

### Fov (Field of View):
Angle in degrees around your crosshair within which targets will be aimed at. Higher values mean more targets can be aimed at around you.

### SilentMoveFix:
Fixes issues when moving silently while aiming. Options: None (no fix), Default (basic fix), Advanced (best fix).

### MoveFixIntave:
Enables movement fixes tailored for Intave servers, improving aim stability.

### AutoShoot:
Automatically fires the bow when your aim is locked on a target.

### No Horizontal Bruteforce:
Prevents unnatural fast horizontal spinning to keep aiming looking legit.

### Entities:
Types of entities the aimbot targets: Players, Mobs, Animals, Invisible entities.
Note: Not using AntiBot might cause the module to attack bots like shopkeepers.

### üéØ AutoShoot Behavior and Warnings

- **üéØ AutoShoot enabled**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è *May look suspicious without smooth aim*
  - ‚úÖ *Combine with Curve or Linear rotation for realism*

- **üß† No AntiBot**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è *Might aim at fake entities or NPCs (increases ban risk)*

- **üé• High FOV**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è *Can cause odd rotations on targets behind you*
