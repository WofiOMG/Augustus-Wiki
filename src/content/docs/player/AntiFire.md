title: AntiFire
---
Helps prevent fire damage by manipulating player movement or packet behavior when the player is on fire.

### OnlyOnGround
Activates AntiFire only when the player is on the ground, avoiding unnecessary actions mid-air.

### MaxPacketPerTick
Limits how many packets related to AntiFire behavior are sent per game tick â€” used to avoid triggering anti-cheat, overloading the server or getting kicked for sending to many packets.
