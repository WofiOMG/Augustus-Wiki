---
The NoRotation module stops your player from automatically rotating to face targets or blocks. It keeps your view fixed or lets you control it manually.

### NoRotation Mode Options
Default: Normal behavior without any rotation changes.  
Test: Experimental mode to try new rotation methods, may be unstable.
