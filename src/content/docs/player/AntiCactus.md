title: AntiCactus
---
Prevents the player from taking damage from cactus blocks by adjusting movement automatically.

### SideOnly

If enabled, AntiCactus only activates when you're touching the **side** of a cactus, not when standing on top. This avoids unnecessary movement correction in safe situations.
