title: NoPlaceDelay
--- 
Removes the normal delay between placing blocks. This remove place delay ticks. Out of vanila, you should probably use FastPlace.

### OnlyOnTheseBlockFaces: down, up, north, south, west, east  
Only removes delay when placing on these sides.

- **up/down** → Y axis (vertical): jumping and falling  
- **north/south** → Z axis (forward/backward)  
- **west/east** → X axis (left/right)

These are Minecraft's 3D coordinates:
- **X** = left/right  
- **Y** = up/down  
- **Z** = forward/backward
