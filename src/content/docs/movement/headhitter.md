title: HeadHitter
---
HeadHitter is situational and strategic (head-hitting). Optimizes upward movement by performing head-hitting jumps to gain extra speed or control in tight spaces.

NoJumpDelay is universal and affects overall jump timing.

Basically, HeadHitter jumps without holding spacebar while NoJumpDelay removes jump ticks (which is equal to spamming jump key).

### OnlyWhileMoving  
Activates only when the player is moving. Prevents jumping when the player is under blocks without user input.

### OnlyWhileJumping  
Activates only while the player is jumping. Only works while jump key is pressed. Using this setting makes it similar to NoJumpDelay but HeadHitter has more settings.

### NotWhileSneaking  
Disables head-hitter while sneaking.

### NotWhileScaffold  
Disables head-hitter when scaffold is active.

### InInventory  
Works while the inventory is open. May close the inventory if blocks are over you and conditions are meet.
