## EXPLOSIONMODIFIER
A module that modifies player velocity and knockback effects caused by explosions.

**XZMultiplierExplosion**
Adjusts horizontal knockback from explosions.

**YMultiplierExplosion**
Adjusts vertical knockback from explosions.

**ModifyVelocityAfterExplosion**
Enables modification of velocity after an explosion occurs.

**XZMultiplierVelocity**
Adjusts horizontal player velocity after explosion.

**YMultiplierVelocity**
Adjusts vertical player velocity after explosion.

Explosion multiplier:
0
No effect — the explosion or velocity has no impact on the player’s movement.

0.50
Reduces the effect to half strength — knockback or velocity is weaker than normal.

1
Default/full effect — normal explosion or velocity impact.

5
Greatly amplifies the effect — knockback or velocity is five times stronger, causing much higher movement.
