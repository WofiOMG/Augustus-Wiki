# SHUFFLEMODE
ShuffleMode makes your screen and all active modules shuffle rapidly, creating a chaotic and disorienting effect.

 Warning: This mode can be very intense and may cause discomfort or dizziness. To disable the module once its active you would have to use command .bind shufflemode (key) or restart your client.
